<p class="doctitle">Reports Sidebar</p>
<p>The Reports Sidebar will help you to get some information about your graphs. This information mainly are mathematical parameters of graphs. For example number of connected components, 
degree list and ...
<br>
The sidebar is empty when the program is started. you should press the Recalculate button, so that Graph<sup>Tea</sup> computes the reports and show the result on a table.

<br>

The reports also has a menu located on <span class="keyword">Graph > Reports</span>, 
using this menus you can directly compute a single report, without wasting your time to compute another reports which you don't need them.
<br>
Some reports may have some parameters. For example the "<span class="keyword">Number of Vertices With Degree K</span>" report has a 
<span class="keyword">K</span> parameter which the report result
is based on. A button appears beside their menu which enables you to modify this parameters. Also by double clicking the report name in the report side bar the same dialog
to modify the parameters will be opened.

<span class="keyword">Reports menu</span> and the <span class="keyword">Parameter Editor
</span>button</p>

<p class="image"><img border="0" src="reports_4.PNG" width="626" height="546"><br>The 
<span class="keyword">Parameter Editor</span> Dialog</p>
<br>
This button will do the similar job when appears in front of any menu of Graph<sup>Tea</sup>.

All reports in Graph<sup>Tea</sup> have a corresponding command in
<span class="keyword">shell</span>. This commands return the value of report. for example: 
<span class="keyword">print(NumOfVerticesWithDegK(2));</span>
