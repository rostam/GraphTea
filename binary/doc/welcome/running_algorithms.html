<p class="doctitle">Running Algorithms</p>
Using Graph<sup>Tea</sup> you can run algorithms on your graphs.  Graph<sup>Tea</sup> algorithm runner will help
you to see how algorithms are running on your graphs, and how they change graphs. You can determine the running speed
of algorithms and also you can run algorithms step by step on graphs.
<br>
Algorithms are located under <span class="keyword">Algorithms</span> menu. When 
you click on these menus a dialog box will open.

  <li><span class="keyword">Pause</span>: Pauses the current playing of 
  algorithms.</li>
  <li><span class="keyword">Play</span>: Plays the algorithm.</li>
  <li><span class="keyword">Play One Step</span>: Plays the algorithm to the 
  next step and the pauses the execution.</li>
  <li><span class="keyword">Speed</span>: The running speed. It changes the 
  delay between steps. Speed=100 is the highest speed and Speed=0 is the lowest.</li>
  <li><span class="keyword">Algorithm Output</span>: The text output algorithm 
  generates. You can copy it by pressing (<span class="keyword">CONTROL 
  + C</span>) and paste&nbsp; it anywhere you like</li>
